"""The takeaway counter's two tools, backed by an in-process demo store.

The compiler copies this file once per tool (`tools/<tool_name>.py`), so a
module-level dict would give each copy its own private store and an order placed
through one would be invisible to the other. One module parked in `sys.modules`
under a name nothing else uses is the smallest thing every copy can reach.

The menu is a few lines of data rather than a database because the point of the
example is the live model and its backend, not the shop. Everything here runs in
process, so a run needs no service beyond the two model keys.
